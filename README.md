# PDF-merger
In order to combine multiple PDFs I needed to import sys to be able to use command line arguments and PyPDF2 libraries so that I could work with PDFs. This time I needed to create my own function with parameter pdf_list. Then I loop through all the PDFs in my param and append them. Then I rename the final PDF Super.dpf and call the function.
