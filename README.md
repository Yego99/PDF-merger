# PDF-merger
This project uses the PyPDF2 library and sys function. With these tools I was able to make a program that combines the PDFs you tell it to in the command prompt as long as they are saved in the same folder you downloaded the code to. 
To use this program:
1)	Install PyPDF2 to your computer 
2)	Download the code to a file of your choice and put the PDFs you want merged in that same file
3)	Open the code and on the second to last line in between the ‘’s type whatever name you want the combined PDF to have
4)	In the command line you will run the program and then put the names of all the PDFs you want merged in the order you want them in
